# ECG-Analysis-with-Heart-rate
HRV, heart rate and R peak detection
The program contains
Loading ecg data as excel file or in .dat format. 
Plotting the raw ECG signal from Lead II configuration. (Lead I, Lead III, avR,	avL,	avF,	V1,	V2,	V3,	V4,	V5,	and V6 also can be done)
Normalized ECG signal
ECG signal with Low Pass filter
ECG signal with High Pass filter
Squared ECG signal 
Averaged ECG signal 
"R peak detection"
Heart Rate variability (HRV)
Heart rate
Normal vs Abnormal condition (Tachycardia and Bradycardia -Threshold can be changed)

Data:
ECG signal - 3 files
Each file contains Lead I, Lead III, avR,	avL,	avF,	V1,	V2,	V3,	V4,	V5,	and V6 signals columnwise.
Signal taken around 10 to 15 second. 
The data is taken in a Lab setup using an ECG circuit done on a breadboard with the help of Gel electrodes and DSO
